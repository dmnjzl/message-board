Great comments and very interesting, especially 5) and 6).

The neural networks in the article is a math model. It is not used to find a solution for "why" problem. Because there is no logic between model input and model output. But it is a very good model featured LEARNING - It can adjust input process, weight assigned to each link, based on the difference between output and target. Just like a kid learn to work. 

A program is a logic process. A programmer writes a program is to implement the logic, no matter how simple or complex it is. But when a programmer completes his work, the program logic will never change. Now it changes. A program can change itself based on the difference between output and target without human interfering. Learning is a human ability. Now a machine has it. And, sometimes or on something, it can learn better than human. For example, [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/
) won in Seoul, South Korea, in March 2016. 

It is not neural networks model amazing. It is its learning ability makes it amazing. Anything, no matter it is human or machine,if it can learn, it has potential; if it cannot, it dies.
